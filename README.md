# Guess-Me-Game

TWO MODES:

Player Mode:

In this mode the user will guess a four digit number that the program has randomly selected from 1000-9999 inclusive. The user will input their guess and the program will return the number of digits matched between the guess and the correct number.

Guess Mode:

In this mode the user will have a four digit number in mind. The program will impliment an algorithm to eefficiently guess the user's number. The user will input how many digits match between the program's guess and the correct number and with this information the program will update their guess. The maximum amount of guesses it should take are 18.

Implimentation Methods:

There are two versions of this game, one that uses array implimentation and one that uses linked list implimentation. The functionality is the same for both programs, however.
